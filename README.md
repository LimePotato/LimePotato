Getting back into programming after a very long hiatus (technically I deleted everything but yanno). Ready to learn and improve! 

I Love everything to do with space, I love science, and I love technology, I've got many ambitions and I plan to see them through.

At the moment Im working on refining my skills in web design, re-learning Java, and learning C#, and Rust. 
Right now I know there's not much here, and most of it not the greatest, but I'm learning What I can Where I can When I can. And it's really fun!
